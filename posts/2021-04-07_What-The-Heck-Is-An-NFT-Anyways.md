NFTs are all the rage right now and I can’t make any sense of it. It’s hard to avoid eye-popping headlines like [“Logan Paul Sells $5 Million Worth of NFTs”](https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/02/22/logan-paul-sells-5-million-nfts-pokemon-box-break/) or [“Jack Dorsey sells his first tweet ever as an NFT for over $2.9 million”](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/jack-dorsey-sells-his-first-tweet-ever-as-an-nft-for-over-2point9-million.html). How do you even sell a tweet to begin with? It's just a string of 280 characters, there’s no intrinsic value, anyone can copy-and-paste the data and claim that tweet as their own. The tweet itself lives on a server (or multiple servers) that Twitter owns which could be forever lost if Twitter ever shut down, or Jack Dorsey decided to delete his tweets. So why in the world would [@sinaEstavi]https://v.cent.co/tweet/20) buy a badly punctuated tweet of five words from Jack Dorsey to the tune of $2.9 million dollars? I don’t get it. More importantly, what are the ethics to consider in selling something so ephemeral as digital data?

Let’s start with the question: what the heck is an NFT anyways? An NFT is a “Non-Fungible Token”, it allows people to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items using cryptographic tokens minted on a blockchain (typically ethereum). In layman terms an NFT is like the certificate of authenticity you would get if you bought an original painting. In the case of an NFT however, the painting is a piece of digital media like a song, video, picture, or even a tweet. The NFT itself is not the piece of media and is separate from the actual item. Basically, what NFT owners get is a cryptographic token that states “I own this item”, some metadata about the purchase, and a link to the actual piece of digital media. The problem I have with NFT’s is this “link” itself. Just like the painting example, the certificate without the art is worthless and so is the NFT with a URL to a missing jpeg.

Anyone who has browsed the internet for any length of time should know that URLs are far removed from being the paragons of permanence required for an NFT. Luckily, many NFT sellers use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer network with unique content-addressing capabilities, to host their content. However, IPFS comes with its own set of problems and teams like [Check My NFT](https://twitter.com/checkmynft?lang=en) have found more than a few NFTs with broken IPFS links.

The question becomes what rights or protections does a buyer of an NFT have beyond the bare bones claim of ownership over the NFT itself. There are no written contracts that tell you what you are getting and what’s enforceable against the seller of the asset. In the end, the burden lies on the consumer to ensure that the purchased digital media continues to be hosted and readily available. Is this arrangement of consumer burden with minimal protections ethically sound? Ultimately, what people spend their money on is their business but consumers should be acutely aware of how fragile their purchase is what the potential outcomes are.

This is not to say that NFTs are all bad. Despite its shortcomings, NFTs are a powerful tool for digital artist attribution, monetization, and combating digital piracy. A free and open market for digital art where artists can be fairly paid is helpful and desirable. However, considering the hype-driven nature of NFT auctions and the house of cards upon which it is built, the whole thing feels a lot like [Tulip mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) and I would rather spend my money elsewhere. Not that I could afford a $40,000 gif from [Taco Bell](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:236696:0x10138d0bf1e7b2b14a833a1a36ca8449b5172919) to begin with.
