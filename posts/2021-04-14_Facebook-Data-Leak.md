Earlier this month the private information of more than 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries was leaked and made widely available online. The sensitive data includes phone numbers, names, addresses, birthdates, and email addresses. The leak is an absolute treasure trove of personal data for nefarious cybercriminals and data brokers alike on the internet. Here’s what Facebook’s Director of Strategic Response Communications, Liz Bourgeois had to say on the matter:

> “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.” - [link](https://twitter.com/Liz_Shepherd/status/1378398417450377222)

Masterclass response, I’m glad that since the data was scraped in 2019 it is now old and inconsequential. Obviously, we all must have changed our names, address, birthdates, and phone numbers since then, so it’s no biggie right? While it’s true that the data is a couple years old, and the vulnerability has since been patched, Facebook's nonchalant response to the issue is more than a little maddening. At the very least a juicy apology and a big banner alerting users to be vigilant against potential fraud seems like the ethical thing to do.

As computing professionals, when users entrust us with their data we must handle it with the utmost care and respect. The ACM tenets to “respect privacy” and “honor confidentiality” don’t suddenly become irrelevant because the data is already leaked and out of our hands. If, by way of our negligence, user information was leaked we should continue to take proactive measures to mitigate the damage by providing long term support for users affected by the breach. Sadly, Facebook doesn’t seem to share this sentiment and have instead adopted the strategy of “We fixed this already, please move along, nothing to see here!”. Since Facebook won’t do it for you, do yourself a favor and go to haveibeenpwned.com and check if your information was part of the data leaked. If it was, then you may want to get ready for more of: “We have been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty”.
